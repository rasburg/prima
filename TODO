- ask Schramm:
  - can 1 folder per day structure be guaranteed (for arbitrary number of days)
  - can we introduce a list of all possible values ? => who will maintain it ?

- crucial
  x consider all pages and all days available
  - migrate to Realm RN
  - configuration mask / let user enter class or if Sek II: own schedule (building blocks => configure subjects => assemble days)
  - save configuration locally (with AsynchStorage), load at startup
  - only show what's still up
  - add error handling (e.g. html does not fit expected regexp structure)
  - pull down to refresh (with spinner)
  - check that every entry is displayed
  - check that search termination works well (e.g. no non-existent day is considered)
  - prevent reloading after navigating back to main menu => caching
  - handle case: day has no entries (notify user)
  - handle case: there are no subst. days (notify user)
  - display "your next subject" in case a schedule is deposited
  - mark "next up" in case there is a substitution
  - support landscape mode
  - test case: incredibly long "message of the day"
  - add tutorial => walk user through configuration process

- visual
  - add unicode support
  - style time display
  - style entry cards, name properties
  - add about page, link to git later on
  - consider header when calculating spinner pos height

- refactor
  - clean up log statements
  - relocate fetching & parsing into separate files
  - change vars to lets
  - relocate URLs to config file
  - relocate utils functions
  - modularize nav screens
  - add locale file
  - stick to 79 char per line limit
  - set up git repo (Readme: React, React Native, CRNA, React Navigation, NativeBase)
  - add comments
  - add documentation / readme / wiki

- move to production
  - setup High Sierra, Xcode, Android Studio
  - eject from CRNA
  - allow for iOS App Transport Security exception
  - test (bundled) on iOS, ask Lara ?
  - test bundled on Android

- publish
  - design icon (blackboard)
  - gather screenshots
  - sign up and deploy to App Store
  - sign up and deploy to Play Store

- refinements
  - add search to whole schedule
  - notify Schramm: additional days must be contained within a separate folder
  - give it a license
